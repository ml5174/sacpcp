              <p>If you’re looking for a way to give back to those in need but don’t have time to visit The Salvation Army facility, Offsite Volunteer Opportunities are a good place to begin. There are several opportunities available for you or a group. 
                The HUGS program provides new Hats, Underwear, Gloves and Socks to our city’s struggling population. Or you can help create Care Kits. These include toiletry kits, first aid kits, home starter kits and back-to-school backpacks filled with school supplies. 
                There’s also an opportunity to make sandwiches and sack lunches. Each day we give out about 350 sack lunches to individuals needing food. You can also help by writing an encouraging word or saying on the sacks to uplift someone’s spirit. 
                Volunteers can do any of these projects themselves or with a group when their schedule allows.
