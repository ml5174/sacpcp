		<p>ABOUT - TSA-CPC DFW</p>

		<p>MISSION </p>
		<p>The Salvation Army, an international movement, is an evangelical part of the universal Christian Church. Its message is based on the Bible. Its ministry is motivated by the love of God. Its mission is to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name without discrimination.</p>
		<p>HISTORY </p>
		<p>William Booth embarked upon his ministerial career in 1852. His crusade was to win the lost multitudes of London to Christ. He went into the streets of London to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to the poor, the homeless, the hungry and the destitute. Booth abandoned the conventional concept of a church and a pulpit and took his message to the people. His wife, Catherine, was a major force in The Salvation Army movement.</p>
		<p>In 1865, William Booth was invited to hold a series of evangelistic meetings in the east end of London. Thieves, prostitutes, gamblers and drunkards were among Booth’s first converts to Christianity. His congregations were desperately poor. He preached hope and salvation. His aim was to lead them to Christ and to link them to a church for further spiritual guidance. Even though they were converted, churches did not accept Booth’s followers because of what they had been. Booth gave their lives direction in a spiritual manner and put them to work to save others who were like themselves. They too preached and sang in the streets as a living testimony to the power of God.</p>
		<p>In 1867, Booth had only 10 full-time workers. By 1874, the numbers had grown to 1,000 volunteers and 42 evangelists. They served under the name “The Christian Mission.” Booth assumed the title of a General Superintendent. His followers called him “General.” Known as the “Hallelujah Army,” the converts spread out of the east end of London into neighboring areas and then to other cities.</p>
		<p>Booth was reading a printer’s proof of the 1878 Annual Report when he noticed the statement, “The Christian Mission under the Superintendent of the Rev. William Booth is a volunteer army.” He crossed out the words “Volunteer Army” and penned in “Salvation Army.”  From those words came the basis of The Salvation Army.</p>
		<p>Today, The Salvation Army is present in over 120 countries, preaching the gospel and providing social services to those in need.</p>
