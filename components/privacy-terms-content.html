            <p style="color:#000000;">
                The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) applies only to application/websites of a commercial nature, and while The Salvation Army DFW Metroplex Command is a nonprofit organization, it considers COPPA to provide sound advice for any application/website that
                is intended for use by children. For this reason, The Salvation Army DFW Metroplex Command does not knowingly collect or solicit any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent.
            </p>
            <p style="color:#000000;">
                In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practicable. With respect to any form
                interface that appears on a webpage at our application/website, no information will be knowingly collected from any user under the age of 13. Where age or date of birth is accepted in a form interface, no information will be stored or transmitted
                unless the response indicates that the user is 13 years of age or older.
            </p>
            <p style="color:#000000;">
                Providing personal information is never a prerequisite for accessing the basic content or resources on this application/website.
